This is an Iron Yard assignment.

Learning Objectives

Most of our browser JavaScript code will be "event-driven" - that is, much of it will execute when some event has occurred, such as the user clicks a button or changes an input field. This assignment will help you practice "handling" those events with functions that will perform some action. In addition, we'll get some more practice changing the DOM.

Your Mission

We'll start this project from a provided job application form page. It uses Bootstrap for some simple styling. We will be handling a few different events (see below) and performing various actions when they occur. One of these actions will be to send the form data to a server. This is where we will want to separate out our code into two modules: one to handle user interface (UI) events, and one to handle the data sending and receiving. In the future we may have many more different modules for different purposes.
